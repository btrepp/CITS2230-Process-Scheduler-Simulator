1.	Running Scheduler

	Usage: [Flag] [Scheduler] [Quantum] [Input File] [Memory Quantum] [-f] [Memoryoutputfile] [-h] 		 
	       [Htmloutputfile]

	Flag :		-s 	Run Scheduler without memory management(default).
			-v	Run Scheduler with memory management.

	Scheduler :	FCFS	First Come First Serve algorithm
			SPN	Shortest Process Next algorithm
			SRT	Shortest Remaining Time algoritm
			RR	Round Robin algorithm

	Quantum :		Set time quantum for use in round robin scheduler process

	Input File : 		File where jobs are to be loaded from

	Memory Quantum :	Print memory usuage at quantum time selected (only if -v is set)

	[-f] :			File to print memory usage to, defaults to vout.file

	Memoryoutputfile :	File that print memory usuage prints into

	[-h] :			Flag for HTML memory visualisation

	Htmloutputfile :	File that Html memory visualisation prints into


2.	Job input file

	Format:	Job[Number] [Arrivaltime] [Processtime] [Pages]
	
	Number :	Index number that is assigned to the job

	Arrivaltime :	Time quanta that the job is to arrive into the CPU

	Processtime :	Time quanta that the job requires the CPU to process for

	Pages :		Number of pages in memory the job requires before it can be processed
